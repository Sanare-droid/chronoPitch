This project revolutionizes baseball analytics by bringing modern Statcast-like metrics to historical footage. Our web application allows users to upload archival baseball videos and automatically extracts key statistics like pitch speed and exit velocity - data that was previously impossible to obtain from older games.

The sleek interface, designed with MLB's classic red and navy color scheme, makes it easy to upload videos and visualize results through interactive charts. Users can either drag-and-drop video files or provide URLs, watch real-time processing progress, and receive detailed analytics including:

Frame-by-frame pitch speed analysis
Exit velocity measurements
Ball trajectory visualization
This tool opens up exciting possibilities for baseball historians and analysts to quantify and compare performances across different eras of the game. Whether you're studying Babe Ruth's legendary home runs or Sandy Koufax's blazing fastballs, our application brings modern analytics to baseball's rich history
